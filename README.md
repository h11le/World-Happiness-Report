# World-Happiness-Report

## Introduction:
In today's rapidly changing world, understanding happiness and its determinants is crucial for fostering well-being and societal progress. The project aims to explore global happiness trends using the World Happiness Report dataset. Through interactive visualizations and analyses, users will gain insights into the factors influencing happiness across different countries and regions.

## Dataset Overview:
The World Happiness Report dataset contains comprehensive information on various factors contributing to happiness levels worldwide. These factors include economic indicators, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. With data spanning multiple years and covering numerous countries, the dataset provides a rich resource for exploring happiness trends and patterns.

## Features of the Shiny App:
• Countries' Distribution: An interactive pie chart will display the distribution of countries based on their regional indicators, providing users with insights into regional differences in happiness levels.

• Dataset Exploration: Users can explore the dataset in detail through an interactive table, allowing for a comprehensive overview of the available data.

• Top 10 (Un)happiest Countries: Users can visualize the top 10 unhappiest countries, with the option to switch between the highest and lowest happiness scores using a radio button.

• Criterion vs. Happiness Score: Users can select specific criteria such as GDP per capita, social support, or perceptions of corruption and visualize their impact on happiness scores across different countries.

• Top 5 Countries by Criterion: Users can explore the top 5 countries based on selected criteria, gaining insights into which countries excel in specific factors contributing to happiness.

• Customization Options: The app provides customization options such as selecting different criteria for analysis, enhancing user engagement and flexibility.

## Objective:
The primary objective of our Shiny app is to provide users with an interactive platform for exploring global happiness trends and understanding the complex interplay of factors influencing happiness levels across countries and regions. By enabling users to visualize and analyze data from the World Happiness Report, we aim to foster greater awareness and insights into the drivers of happiness worldwide.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, our proposed Shiny app offers a valuable tool for exploring global happiness trends using the World Happiness Report dataset. Through interactive visualizations and analyses, users can gain a deeper understanding of the key determinants of happiness and their variations across different countries and regions. By empowering users to explore and interpret happiness data, our app contributes to ongoing efforts to promote well-being and societal progress worldwide.
